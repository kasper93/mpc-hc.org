title: v1.7.10 is released
---

After 5 months since our last stable build, we are happy to announce v1.7.10.

This release is a bugfix release, with many improvements and a few new features.

A few highlights of this release:
TBA

Don't forget, that our official builds, both the stable and the beta builds,
[are digitally signed](/2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed/).
Be aware of scams and only get the files from our site!

Also, to report bugs, suggestions and generally provide feedback, use our [Trac](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/);
reporting anything on social media or in any other place is just pointless, as the developers only follow Trac.

You can download the new version [here](/downloads/).
For the complete changes see the [changelog](/changelog/).
